          <p id="overview">
            The technology and the proficiency required to build custom-fit solutions that reach a high level of
            expertise is quite challenging. Tools like web frameworks make the web application development painless.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let us take a look at what is a Web Framework? During end of 90's and beginning of 20's developers had to
            write boiler plate code to build web applications. Each web applications were developed from scratch. This
            approach was not scalable when it came to non trivial web applications. Many questions arised:
          <ul>
            <li>How to reduce time taken to market, if you do every development from scratch?</li>
            <li> How complex web pages like interacting with multiple databses can be developed?</li>
            <li> How to reuse similar code across multiple applications? </li>
            <li> How can developer concentrate on business logic rather than writing bolier plate code?</li>
          </ul>
          Web application frameworks are evolved to solve these problems. A web application framework is a programming
          infrastructure for your applications.
          Where the developer concentrate on busines logic than the boiler plate code and helps to reduce the time taken
          to reach market. Allows reusing of features and also helps to write clean and maintainable code. Django is one
          such framework with many features to make developer's life easy.
          </p>

            <b>What is Django?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Django is quite a famous and well-featured server side framework, written in Python. Django enables hasty
            development of protected as well as sustainable websites. Django encourages you to build complete,
            adaptable,
            versatile, secure and lightweight softwares.
            <br>
            <br>
            In view of the quantity of prominent sites that make use of Django, the number of individuals consistently
            adding to the codebase of this framework, and the count of persons giving both free and paid for support
            options, we can imagine Django's popularity.
          </p>
          <p id="overview_django_framework">
            <b>Django Framework</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Django is a free and open source framework that deals with a great part of the issue of web development,
            such
            that now you can concentrate completely on creating your application without bothering about remodeling a
            pre-existing solution. Thus, it relieves a huge portion of the overhead involved in creating a new site.
            <br>
            <br>
            Django follows the "Batteries included" concept making it a complete product in itself. With this framework,
            one can build nearly any type of website. Moreover, Django is capable of working with various categories of
            client-side frameworks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Django can run your app on different platforms which makes it highly portable.

            <br>
            <br>
            Django is a collection of Python libraries. So to develop and run Django applications, we need Python
            installed on the computer. The recommended version of Python is 3. You can verify Python installation by
            typing <code>'python'</code> in command-line. Below is a sample from Mac Os.
          <pre>
              <code>
$python
Python 2.7.16 (default, Jan 26 2020, 23:50:38)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.31)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
              </code>
            </pre>
          If not installed, you’ll have to download and install Python.
          </p>

            <b>IDE</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            You can choose on of your favorite IDE from below list. For beginners Visual Studio Code is recommended.
          <ul>
            <li>PyCharm</li>
            <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
            <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
            <li>Sublime Text</li>

            <b>Database</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are developing a database application you also need to install Django supported database. SQLite
            database is coming with Python itself.

        <article id="first_django_application" style="text-align:justify">
          <h2>First django app</h2>
          <p id="app_location">
            <b>App Location</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Create an application folder in a prefered location of your computer.
          <pre>
              <code>
$ mkdir django_tutorial
              </code>
            </pre>

          <p id="app_virtual_environment">
            <b>Virtual Environment</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Before installing Django, it's prescribed to introduce a self-contained directory tree, a Virtualenv that
            establishes new disconnected environments which separate your Python records for every project you create.
            <br>
            Go inside the app location (<code>cd django_tutorial</code>) to create the virtual environment using
            following command.
            <br>
          <pre>
          <code>
In MacOS command-line
django_tutorial$ python3 -m venv tutorialenv 

In Windows command-line
C:\Users\Name\django_tutorial>python -m venv tutorialenv

          </code>
        </pre>
          </p>


          <p id="app_install_django">
            <b>Install Django</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, since we created a virtual environment, next step will be to activate it using the below command.
          <pre>
          <code>
In MacOS command-line
$source tutorialenv/bin/activate

In Windows Command-line
C:\Users\Name>tutorialenv/Scripts/activate

          </code>
        </pre>
          As soon as you find the prompt in your console having (tutorialenv) as prefix, this implies that your virtual
          env has been initiated.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, we are now ready to Install Django. There are 3 methods to install Django, the best being the one
          using pip command which gives us the latest stable version of Django. So in this tutorial, we suggest the same
          pip tool for installation.

          <pre>
        <code>
In MacOS Command-line
(tutorialenv) ~django_tutorial$pip3 install django

In Window
command -line
(tutorialenv) C:\Users\Name>tutorialenv/Scripts>pip install django

          </code>
          </pre>
          </p>

          <p id="app_start">
            <b>Start the app</b>
            <br>
            <br>

            Let’s begin to build our First app and see how to start it. The initial step is to start a new Django
            project. Essentially, this implies that we'll run a few scripts given by Django that will make a frame of a
            Django project. This is only a collection of directories and records that we will be utilizing later on.

            The names of certain files are significant for Django. Note an important suggestion at this point, you ought
            not rename or change the location of such files for a Django project.

            In order to start the project, follow these steps -
          <pre>
            <code>
For MacOS In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ django-admin startproject tutorial-site .
(Note the period at the end is mandatory.) 

For Windows In command-line
(tutorialenv) C:\Users\Name>django-admin startproject tutorial-site 
            </code>
          </pre>


          Next stage is the setting up of Database. In this app we will be using the default database, sqlite3. So,
          we just need to do migrations using the next command on the console -
          <pre>
            <code>
In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ python manage.py migrate
        </code>
      </pre>
      We now try to start our first app, just type in the following command on the console -
      <pre>
        <code>
In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ python manage.py runserver
        </code>
      </pre>

          Finally we have built our first website which is running on localhost. In order to view this, just navigate to
          the following URL on your local web browser
          http://127.0.0.1:8000/

          You get to see your website running !!!
