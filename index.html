          <p id="overview">
            The technology and the proficiency required to build custom-fit solutions that reach a high level of
            expertise is quite challenging. Tools like web frameworks make the web application development painless.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let us take a look at what is a Web Framework? During end of 90's and beginning of 20's developers had to
            write boiler plate code to build web applications. Each web applications were developed from scratch. This
            approach was not scalable when it came to non trivial web applications. Many questions arised:
          <ul>
            <li>How to reduce time taken to market, if you do every development from scratch?</li>
            <li> How complex web pages like interacting with multiple databses can be developed?</li>
            <li> How to reuse similar code across multiple applications? </li>
            <li> How can developer concentrate on business logic rather than writing bolier plate code?</li>
          </ul>
          Web application frameworks are evolved to solve these problems. A web application framework is a programming
          infrastructure for your applications.
          Where the developer concentrate on busines logic than the boiler plate code and helps to reduce the time taken
          to reach market. Allows reusing of features and also helps to write clean and maintainable code. Django is one
          such framework with many features to make developer's life easy.
          </p>

            <b>What is Django?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Django is quite a famous and well-featured server side framework, written in Python. Django enables hasty
            development of protected as well as sustainable websites. Django encourages you to build complete,
            adaptable,
            versatile, secure and lightweight softwares.
            <br>
            <br>
            In view of the quantity of prominent sites that make use of Django, the number of individuals consistently
            adding to the codebase of this framework, and the count of persons giving both free and paid for support
            options, we can imagine Django's popularity.
          </p>
          <p id="overview_django_framework">
            <b>Django Framework</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Django is a free and open source framework that deals with a great part of the issue of web development,
            such
            that now you can concentrate completely on creating your application without bothering about remodeling a
            pre-existing solution. Thus, it relieves a huge portion of the overhead involved in creating a new site.
            <br>
            <br>
            Django follows the "Batteries included" concept making it a complete product in itself. With this framework,
            one can build nearly any type of website. Moreover, Django is capable of working with various categories of
            client-side frameworks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Django can run your app on different platforms which makes it highly portable.

            <br>
            <br>
            Django is a collection of Python libraries. So to develop and run Django applications, we need Python
            installed on the computer. The recommended version of Python is 3. You can verify Python installation by
            typing <code>'python'</code> in command-line. Below is a sample from Mac Os.
          <pre>
              <code>
$python
Python 2.7.16 (default, Jan 26 2020, 23:50:38)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.31)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
              </code>
            </pre>
          If not installed, you’ll have to download and install Python.

            If you are developing a database application you also need to install Django supported database. SQLite
            database is coming with Python itself.

        <article id="first_django_project" style="text-align:justify">
          <h2 style="color:brown">First django project</h2>
          In Djangot we often come across Projects and Apps. A project refers to the entire application and all its
          parts.
          An app refers to a submodule of the project.
          <p id="project_location">
            <b>Project Location</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Create an project folder in a prefered location of your computer.
          <pre>
              <code>
$ mkdir django_tutorial
              </code>
            </pre>
          </p>


          <p id="project_virtual_environment">
            <b>Virtual Environment</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Before installing Django, it's prescribed to introduce a self-contained directory tree, a Virtualenv that
            establishes new disconnected environments which separate your Python records for every project you create.
            <br>
            Go inside the project location (<code>cd django_tutorial</code>) to create the virtual environment using
            following command.
            <br>
          <pre>
          <code>
In MacOS command-line
django_tutorial$ python3 -m venv tutorialenv 

In Windows command-line
C:\Users\Name\django_tutorial>python -m venv tutorialenv
          </code>
        </pre>
          </p>


          <p id="project_install_django">
            <b>Install Django</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, since we created a virtual environment, next step will be to activate it using the below command.
          <pre>
          <code>
In MacOS command-line
$source tutorialenv/bin/activate

In Windows Command-line
C:\Users\Name>tutorialenv/Scripts/activate
          </code>
        </pre>
          As soon as you find the prompt in your console having (tutorialenv) as prefix, this implies that your virtual
          env has been initiated.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, we are now ready to Install Django. There are 3 methods to install Django, the best being the one
          using pip command which gives us the latest stable version of Django. So in this tutorial, we suggest the same
          pip tool for installation.

          <pre>
        <code>
In MacOS Command-line
(tutorialenv) ~django_tutorial$pip3 install django

In Window
command -line
(tutorialenv) C:\Users\Name>tutorialenv/Scripts>pip install django
          </code>
          </pre>
          </p>

          <p id="project_start">
            <b>Start the project</b>
            <br>
            <br>

            Let’s begin to build our First project and see how to start it. The initial step is to start a new Django
            project. Essentially, this implies that we'll run a few scripts given by Django that will make a frame of a
            Django project. This is only a collection of directories and records that we will be utilizing later on.

            The names of certain files are significant for Django. Note an important suggestion at this point, you ought
            not rename or change the location of such files for a Django project.

            In order to start the project, follow these steps -
          <pre>
            <code>
For MacOS In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ django-admin startproject tutorial_site .
(Note the period at the end is mandatory.) 

For Windows In command-line
(tutorialenv) C:\Users\Name>django-admin startproject tutorial_site 
            </code>
          </pre>


          Next stage is the setting up of Database. In this project we will be using the default database, sqlite3. So,
          we just need to do migrations using the next command on the console -
          <pre>
            <code>
In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ python manage.py migrate
        </code>
      </pre>
          We now try to start our first project, just type in the following command on the console -
          <pre>
        <code>
In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ python manage.py runserver
        </code>
      </pre>
          Finally we have built our first website which is running on localhost.
          <br>
          In order to view this, just navigate to the following URL on your local web browser.

          <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>
          <br>
          You get to see your website running !!!

          <h2 style="color:brown">First Django App (mvc)</h2>
          <br>
          An app is a component or feature of the project. For example In an e-commerce project products abd cart can be
          two apps. Use below command to create an App.
          <pre>
          <code>
In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$     python manage.py startapp book
          </code>
        </pre>
          Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern used for web applications.
          Design pattern are certain standards used in software development to standardise variuos components and its
          interactions.
          <br>
          <br>
          MVC is one such pattern which helps to keep the code for defining and accessing data (Model) separate from
          request routing logic (Controller), which in turn is separate from the user interface (View).
          </p>

          <p id="mvc_models">
            <b>Django Models</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Django web applications access and manage data from databse and write to database through Python objects
            known as models.
            Whenever you've picked what database you need for your app(Which is supported by Django), you are free from
            the burden of writing complex queries, as Django will manage all
            communications with the database on your behalf.
            <br>
            <br>
            A model is a class that enables to interact with a table in our DB, and where each property of the class is
            a
            field of the table.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Django <code>model</code> is the built-in component that Django uses to generate tables and fields.
            Models are characterized in the app/models.py file. so we open this file residing within our
            app’s folder (app - give here the name of your own application) edit the code in IDE to look like:
          <pre>
              <code>
# book/models.py
1 from django.db import models
2
3 class Book(models.Model):
4 # Fields
5 	book_name = models.CharField(max_length=125)
6 	author_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
7 
8 #Methods
9 def get_book_count(self):
10
11
12 def _str_(self):
13	return self.book_name;
              </code>
            </pre>
          The final step here is to include our newly created model Book to our database. But first we will have to
          ensure Django knows the changes we did to our new model Book. In order to do this we need to make migrations
          using following command.
          <pre>
              <code>
In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ python manage.py makemigrations tutorial-site
              </code>
            </pre>

          Django is now ready with the migration file which will now be added to our database once we type this command
          python manage.py migrate tutorial-site on the console.

          <pre>
              <code>            
In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ python manage.py migrate tutorial-site
            </code>
            </pre>
          Finally, with these steps we have added our self-created model Book to the database.
          </p>


          <p id="mvc_controller">
            <b>Django URLs</b>
            <br>
            <br>


            The urls.py file specifies which view is called for a mentioned URL. Whenever a user generates a request for
            any page of your site, Django controller looks through the urls.py file, to find the respective view thus
            returning the proper HTML response.

            Open the app/urls.py file located within our app’s folder (app - give here the name of your own application)
            and edit the code in IDE to look as :
          <pre>
  <code>
# book/urls.py

1 from django.urls import path
2 from . import views
3 urlpatterns = [(path ‘ ‘ , views.book_list, name=’book_list’),
     # you can add more paths here
]
  </code>
</pre>


          We are importing Django’s function path and all of the views from your app. Line 3 is important as it defines
          a mapping between URLs and views. In the sample, we assign a view named as book_list to the root URL.
          </p>


          <p id="mvc_views">
            <b>Django Views</b>

            <br>
            A view sources information from your data set and conveys it to a template. The views.py file comprises the
            business logic for a page within your website.

            Open the app/views.py file located within our app’s folder (app - give here the name of your own
            application) and edit the code in IDE to look as :
          <pre>
              <code>
# book/views.py

1 from django.shortcuts import render
2 from django.http import HttpResponse
3
4 def book_list(request):
5 	return render(request, ‘app/book_list.html’, {})
</code>
</pre>
          </p>


          <p id="mvc_form">
            <b>Django Forms</b>
            <br>
            <br>


            HTML Forms are a flexible means of gathering input from the client having a provision for various types of
            data, like text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.

            <a href="#bibliography_2" style="color: brown;"><b>[2]</b></a>Django provides a helper class that lets you
            create a Form class from a
            Django model. This class can save the output of the form to the model directly.



            Open the app/forms.py file from our app’s folder and edit the code in IDE to look like :
          <pre>
              <code>
# app/forms.py

1 from django import forms
2 from django.forms import ModelForm
3 from .models import * 		#import all model classes
4 
5 class TaskForm(forms.ModelForm)
6   # TaskForm class inherits from the ModelForm
7 
8	 class Meta:	        #internal class to ModelForm
9	    model = Task       #base model for our form
10	    fields = ‘_all_’    #Django allowed to use all the form fields
              </code>
            </pre>

          Now, since we are done with creating the ModelForm, we need to make a new view to manage this form, build a
          form template and include the new view and form to the urls.py file in order to link to the form.


          </p>


          <p id="mvc_orm">
            <b>Django ORM</b>
            <br>
            <br>

            Object-relational mapper(ORM) is used to transfer data between model object and relational database.
            The ORM automates this data transfer, and the developer need not write any SQL. ORM helps to write
            error-free free code and helps to increase productivity.

        <article id="django_admin" style="text-align:justify">
          <p>
          <h2 style="color:brown">Django Admin</h2>
          A web-based administrative backend is a standard component of most current sites. This interface, called as
          admin, permits confided site heads to build, alter and distribute content, manage the site clients and perform
          other managerial functions.

          Django accompanies an underlying administrator interface. With Django's administrator you can confirm clients,
          show and handle forms, and approve input; all autonomously.
          The Django admin application uses your models in order to automatically generate a site area which can be
          utilized to create, display, edit and remove records. The Django project suggests to use it only for use
          internally within your organization, since this interface provides a lot of irrelevant details to the clients
          (which are best if hidden).

          <a href="#bibliography_1" style="color: brown;"><b>[1]</b></a> All the configuration required to include the
          admin application in our
          website was done automatically when we created our First Django Project(which was discussed earlier in the
          tutorial).

          Now we are left with registering the models we created in the previous stage, so as to add them to the admin
          application. In order to achieve this, let’s open the app/admin.py file located within our app’s folder (app -
          give here the name of your own application) and edit the code in IDE to look as :



          <pre>
  <code>
# app/admin.py
1 from django.contrib import admin
2 
3 #Register your model Book
4
5 from .models import Book
6 
7 admin.site.register(Book)
</code>
</pre>


          Using this sample code, you can register a model (or multiple models) with the admin site.

          We can also try creating a superuser, by following -
          <pre>
  <code>
For MacOS: In command-line
(tutorialenv) ~$ python manage.py createsuperuser

For Windows: In command-line
(tutorialenv) C:\Users\Name> python manage.py createsuperuser
</code>
</pre>

          Now, a new superuser has been added to the database, which can be viewed if you restart the development
          server.

          <h2 style="color:brown">Future and Conclusions</h2>
          Django was initially developed to manage one-side, synchronous and request-response interactions based
          on HTTP protocol. There was no support for non-HTTP protocols like websockets.
          <br>
          Django 3.1, which just released a few weeks earlier, has asynchronous protocol support. This version is
          backward compatible and
          which ensures a shining future of Django in both sync and async protocols!
